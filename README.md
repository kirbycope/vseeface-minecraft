A Minecraft Avatar for VSeeFace. It uses my skin but I'll include hot to make your own.

## Using the Avatar
1. Download the [avatar](/Assets/Kirbycope.vrm)
1. Download [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/#download) and unarchive.
1. In the VSeeFace folder, double-click on "VSeeFace.exe".
1. Select "Add Avatar" and select Kirbycope.vrm
1. Select "Start"

## How It was Made
- [Minecraft Vtuber Model! âœ© Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHda8H3eMcY) by Argama Witch
- I used [v0.58.0](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases/tag/v0.58.0) of UniVRM becuase it had documenation about [BlendedShapes](https://vrm.dev/en/univrm/export/univrm_export.html#v0-58) and that Argama was using VRM0 as well.
