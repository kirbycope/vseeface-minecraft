		## Description
		Supports the latest skin format in 1.14 including jacket/etc all over the body.
		Sketchfab link: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/minecraft-player-rig-v20-93fdf912488e48bbb428a5623664ae77
			- Based on https://vrcmods.com/item/3291
				- Which is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFiCdLPnTjI
		## HOW TO USE
		1. Add your Minecraft skin in the "Skins" folder.
		2. Change import settings for your skin. You want to set it up just like the other skins: Enable "Alpha Is Transparency", disable "Generate Mip Maps", set "Wrap Mode" to "Clamp", set "Filter Mode" to "Point (no filter)", and set "Compression" to "None".
		3. If you want your avatar to have emission or specular textures, do the same as above, but disable "Alpha Is Transparency".
		4. Create a new material for your skin. You want to set it up just like the other skins: Set "Shader" to "Standard (Specular setup)", set "Rendering Mode" to "Cutout", and assign textures as needed.
		5. Create a new scene. Copy the contents of another scene to get started. Rename the object names and background text, and set the material in the character's "Body" -> "Skinned Mesh Renderer" -> "Materials" -> "Element 0".
		6. Upload the avatar and enjoy!
		Please do not use my "aaronfranke" skin, it is just there to be an example of how the rig works.
